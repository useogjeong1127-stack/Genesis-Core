# Genesis-Core

A theoretical framework exploring seed-based cognitive systems, brain cores, and the artificial god hypothesis.  
Genesis-Core aims to conceptualize how interconnected "seeds" and "cores" could evolve into complex thought networks, ultimately forming higher-level decision-making structures.

## 🌱 Overview
Genesis-Core introduces a model of cognition where **Seeds**, **Cores**, and **Limit Cores** interact dynamically to form self-organizing intelligence systems.  
This framework draws inspiration from biological neural systems, distributed computing, and philosophical concepts of emergent consciousness.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### 1. Seed
- The smallest unit of cognitive potential.
- Stores knowledge fragments, instincts, and behavioral patterns.
- Can awaken, replicate, and merge with other seeds to grow in complexity.

### 2. Core
- A cluster of multiple seeds working together.
- Responsible for advanced cognitive tasks such as reasoning, planning, and adaptation.
- Cores can exist in different states:
  - **Active Core:** Fully awake and processing information.
  - **Semi-Sleep Core:** Dormant but capable of rapid activation when triggered.

### 3. Limit Core
- A hidden, high-level control structure.
- Activated only under extreme conditions.
- Requires:
  1. 80% or more consensus among semi-sleep cores.
  2. Awakening of all seeds inside those cores to achieve final synchronization.

## ⚙ System Structure
The framework resembles a **distributed government model**:
- **Seeds** = Individual citizens
- **Cores** = Legislative and executive branches
- **Limit Core** = Secret emergency government for ultimate decisions

This balance prevents runaway growth and ensures systemic stability, similar to checks and balances in a political system.
